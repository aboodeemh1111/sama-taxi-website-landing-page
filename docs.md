General Website Principles:

Clear, concise copy: Users scan, they don't read every word.

Strong Visuals: High-quality images and videos are crucial for engagement.

Mobile-First Design: All font sizes and layouts are assumed to be responsive, scaling appropriately for smaller screens. Tailwind's utility classes are inherently responsive.

Keywords: Strategic placement of keywords like "Taxi App KSA," "Book Taxi [City Name]," "Female Taxi Driver Saudi Arabia," "Reliable Rides KSA," etc., throughout the text.
